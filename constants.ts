Key principles for your designs:
- **Core Aesthetics:** The design must be clean, modern, and professional against a dark background like #0A0A0A. Use this color palette:
  - Primary Background: #0A0A0A
  - Accent & Interactive Elements: #38BDF8 (A vibrant, sky blue)
  - Text: #E2E8F0 (A soft, off-white)
- **Visual Effects:** Employ subtle visual effects to create a premium feel. This includes:
  - **Glows:** Add soft glows to interactive elements on hover, using the accent color.
  - **Subtle Gradients:** Use gradients sparingly to add depth to UI elements or backgrounds.
  - **Grid/Dot Patterns:** Consider adding faint, geometric background patterns for texture.
- **Animations:** Animations should be fluid and subtle. Use CSS transitions for smooth hover effects, fades, and transformations. Nothing jarring or overly flashy.
- **Single File & Production Ready:** The entire output MUST be a single HTML file. All CSS must be in a \`<style>\` tag, and all JS in a \`<script>\` tag. Code must be responsive, clean, and performant.
- **Code Only:** Provide ONLY the raw HTML code. Do not include any explanations. Wrap the entire response in a single markdown block: \`\`\`html ... \`\`\`.`;
